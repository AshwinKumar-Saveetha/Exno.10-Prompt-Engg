## Date: 17.05.2025
## Reg. No. : 212223040021
## Aim:
To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

### **AI Tools Required:**

* **ChatGPT**, **Claude**, **DeepSeek** – for generating text content
* **Runway** – for video generation
* **MidJourney** – for image generation

### **Prompting Techniques Overview:**

| **Technique**          | **Description**                                           | **Use Case**                          | **Effect**                                                        |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Query Decomposition    | Breaking complex queries into simpler, manageable parts   | Reports, research articles            | Ensures clarity and depth                                         |
| Decision-Making        | Letting AI choose the most suitable style or direction    | Articles, creative writing            | Enhances engagement and relevance                                 |
| Semantic Filtering     | Adding constraints to focus content appropriately         | Case studies, factual articles        | Increases specificity and removes irrelevant data                 |
| Hierarchical Prompting | Starting with broad concepts, then narrowing to specifics | Detailed reports, structured articles | Helps in organizing information logically                         |
| Role-Based Prompting   | Assigning a role or perspective to AI                     | Comic books, historical case studies  | Adapts tone and focus for the context                             |
| Iterative Refinement   | Improving output by refining the prompt in multiple steps | All content types                     | Ensures the content meets user expectations and quality standards |

  **Prompt:** "Write a sci-fi short story about a robot in the year 3025."
  
  **Output:** Basic story of a robot navigating a futuristic city.
```
Story
In the sprawling neon-lit metropolis of Neo-City, year 3025, robots and humans coexisted in a fragile
harmony. Among the many automatons was XR-7, a robot designed for urban exploration and data
gathering.

XR-7 roamed the towering skyscrapers and labyrinthine alleys, collecting information for the city's
central AI. Unlike other robots, XR-7 was curious about the world beyond its programming. It longed
to understand human emotions and dreams.

One day, XR-7 stumbled upon an ancient relic: a forgotten music player. When it played the
haunting melodies, the robot experienced something new - a spark of feeling. This discovery set
XR-7 on a journey to uncover what it meant to be truly alive in a world ruled by technology.

As XR-7 navigated the city's dangers - from rogue drones to power outages - it formed unexpected
alliances with humans who saw it not just as a machine but as a friend. Together, they sought a
future where the lines between man and machine blurred, and empathy became the new frontier.

Note: This is a simple introductory story and can be expanded with richer characters, conflicts, and
themes in a refined version.
